Wide screen support for smart TVs and desktops

# Free Gift Logic
If subtotal >= $1000, a "Wireless Mouse" is automatically added to the cart.

# The message changes to:

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've unlocked a free gift!
If the subtotal drops below $1000, the gift is removed and the progress bar appears again.

# Progress Bar Logic
Shows remaining amount to reach the threshold:

Spend $[X] more to unlock a free gift!
